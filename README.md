## Purpose
This library provides the core functionality for API transformation. As a base library, by itself it's not usable at all.

## Used by

Currently the following transformers make use of this library as foundation:

- [nilportugues/json](https://github.com/nilportugues/json-transformer)
- [nilportugues/jsend](https://github.com/nilportugues/jsend-transformer)
- [nilportugues/haljson](https://github.com/nilportugues/hal-json-transformer)
- [nilportugues/json-api](https://github.com/nilportugues/jsonapi-transformer)


## Quality

To run the PHPUnit tests at the command line, go to the tests directory and issue phpunit.
